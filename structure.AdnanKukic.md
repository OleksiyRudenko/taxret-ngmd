                       creation section, etc). Each page should have it’s own subfolder
                       with it’s own controller, services, and HTML files.
                     # Each component here will resemble a mini-MVC application by having
                       a view, controller and potentially services file(s). If the component
                       has multiple related views, it may be a good idea to further separate
                       these files into ‘views’, ‘controllers’, ‘services’ subfolders.

## Best Practices

### Modularize the Header and Footer

A good practice here would be to create a Core subfolder under components, and then a
subfolder for the Header and Footer and any additional components that will be shared
across many pages.

### Modularize the Routes

In the structure above we didn’t do this, but another good practice for very large
apps is to separate the routes into separate files. For example you might add a
`blogRoutes.js` file in the `/views/blog/` subfolder and there include only the routes
relevant to the blog such as `/blog/:slug`, `/blog/:slug/edit`, `blog/tags:/tags`, etc.

### Don’t Forget to Minify

If you do decide to opt in and build your AngularJS apps in a modularized fashion,
be sure to concatenate and minify your code before going into production. There are
many great extensions for both Grunt and Gulp that will help with this – so don’t be
afraid to split code up as much as you need.

You may not want to necessarily have just one giant `.js` file for your entire app,
but concatenating your app into a few logical files like:

*    `app.js` (for app initialization, config and routing)
*    `services.js` (for all the services)

### Keep the Names Consistent

This is more of a general tip, but this will save you a headache in the future,
when writing components and you need multiple files for the component, try to
name them in a consistent pattern. For example, `blogView.html`, `blogServices.js`,
`blogController.js`.
