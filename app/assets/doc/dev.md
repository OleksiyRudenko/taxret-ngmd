## Preface
Well, I do not have yet experience beyond primitive tiny apps.
This project is an attempt to build a small yet valuable app.
See `structure.md` in project root for the meanings of tiny and small apps.

The app is focused on Ukrainian audience. Please, look at
`about.md` for the idea behind
and `user.md` for user's manual
(both documents are in Ukrainian).

This document describes technical aspects of project implementation
and designed for developer's quick reference.

See `README.md` for project set-up reference.

[Demo](http://oleksiyrudenko.github.io/taxret-ngmd/app/#/declarants)
is based on `dev` branch. [2016-04-09]

*Please, do not hesitate contacting me via
[github](https://github.com/OleksiyRudenko), whenever you find
any reference to external resource significantly outdated.*

## Builders and Package managers
### Builders
[Opinion re builders 2014-10-30](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/)

[`npm` as a build tool 2014-12-09](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/)

[brunch.io](http://brunch.io/) - a better Gulp
(last commit 2016-04-08 [2016-04-09])

Gulp (a better Grunt)

Grunt
### Package managers
`npm`+`browserify` (to concatenate modules into bigger minified files)
vs `bower`.
