# Project Structure

## Purpose

This is an attempt to elaborate the folder structure for a project, which would
serve developer's needs keeping in mind scalability from tiny to huge while yet
adhering to best practices available.

While folder structure should be kept as
[flat](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y143)[2016-04-10]
as possible the proper initial set up is also important especially for novice
developers. Often the pre-set form helps keeping adherent to structure during
development cycle and on scaling saving efforts on migration and refactoring.

So we are trying to develop optimum folder structure.

## Credits

Not only [Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)
by John Papa is a good source of development style but also a source of good
practices on organizing documents and references.

**Why outcome comes first?**

In business it often happens that we say *Here is the solution: .... Here is
reasoning behind, briefly:...* and *What part of reasoning would you like us
to unveil in more details?*

In finance it is normally said *This is our technical result, which comprises of ...
[1000 accounts drilling down to every single transaction] ...*

So, we just employ the same approach: the outcome and then explanation helping
track the reasoning.

## Input
###### [Structure [S300](#structure-s300)]

There is a number of overviews, guidelines and best practices described on the topic.
There is even more projects employing that or other file structure.

While it is clear that folders-by-feature structure has its significant advantages over
[file and folder patterns](https://medium.com/opinionated-angularjs/scalable-code-organization-in-angularjs-9f01b594bf06)[2013-11-20]
in many cases such factors as development cycle using build management tools and application
scale often stay beyond the scope.

Again, novice developer focused on development itself often knowing a little about
full-scale development environment and scaling pitfalls to take proper decisions on
project file structure.

### Common points
###### [Structure [S301](#structure-s301)]

More or less there is common understanding of structure in general: project
root folder contains:

* appication folder
* folder for third-party (vendor) components like libraries and frameworks such as AngularJS
* build management tools' files and folders
* general project documentation (purpose, intro, installation etc)

The most of authors advocate folder-by-feature structure. I.e. each component has its own
folder containing all files required and attributed specifically to given component.
Reusable (in various projects) components should be "copy-pastable". It means that even
such assets like images, specific solely to a component should also be incapsulated therein.

### Critical discrepancies
###### [Structure [S302](#structure-s302)]


app/client/src?
src/app/client?

local development: client, server, external services and resources (temporarily kept local)
for development phase.


Project development supportive infrastructure: builders, git, intro doc
client+server
documentation: project, dev guides, user guides

tiny: standalone run for tiny apps (open index.html in browser and that's it)
      local copies of vendor libs
      keep in mind possible growth to small, medium & even large
      `/...` vs `../../../...` reference style - serve both http://localhost/ and file:/// patterns
      gh-pages roll-out issue (use redir script in app root)

small: use local server for development, serving both front and back ends; no build
middle+: +build overheads
