This app groups code by feature but not to the point of grouping
the templates/tests/css inside it (it's really easy to change
that in the gulpfile if you want to do that though).

Look at the home module present in the boilerplate to see how
you can integrate a module in the angular app and.
There's also an exemple service and directive.

There are couple conventions in place that you should follow:

**Client**
* Each feature folder should have file `_module.ts` declaring
  new angular module, which should be referenced in the
  `client/_module.ts`.
  I decided to avoid things like `ocLazyLoad` or `angularAMD`
  due to introduced complexity. That's why main _module.ts has
  dependency on feature modules. This means that all `_module`
  files (not any other files from a given feature) will be
  loaded on initial load, but that's OK since they are small.
* Each `angular.module` should have this:
  `ngAmdProvider.configure(app);` in its configuration function.
  This allows angular controllers, services, directive, and
  the rest to be registered asynchronously - when the file loads.
* Each ui.router state options should be wrapped in
  `ngAmdProvider.resolve('client/home/home', {...})`.
  See example in `client/_module.ts`.
  We need to load code for the component that is used in
  the `template` option when we navigate to a state.

**Server**
* Each api route should be placed in a separate file under
  `server/routes/api`. It also should be registered in
  `server/routeHandler` with the appropriate url path.
